I'm a Work and Organizational Psychologist having professional experience as a Data Scientist specialized in traditional Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning with a basic knowledge of Business Administration.

üó∫Ô∏è My experience:
*	Python programming skills at an object-oriented level and a profound knowledge in applying Data Science methods and Machine Learning algorithms
*	Extensive experience applying analytical skills to investigate and solve complex problems from both startup and corporate environments
*	Several years of experience integrating psychological approaches and methods into knowledge transfer, consulting, and solution finding for improved customer outcomes

üíπ My successes:
*	Developing customer-focused solutions that have increased sales, image, satisfaction, and visibility, even in times of constrained budgets
*	Expertise in developing various deep learning architectures and efficiently deploying and optimizing ML models for production use
*	Driving internal improvements to reduce the workload of the team, as well as promoting data-driven skills in times of skills shortages

üí™ My strengths:
*	Interdisciplinary thinking from human factors and business management to optimize business decisions through multi-layered data perspectives
*	Precision and accuracy in identifying critical relationships and patterns that help minimize risks and maximize opportunities
*	Skills in effective presentation and communication to solve complex data problems to improve business outcomes

üí° My interests:
*	Passion for data and its potential to solve complex problems and provide valuable insights to stay competitive
*	Interest in the latest technologies and scientific developments in AI to develop solutions to the challenges of the future
*	Impact of AI on society and environment, that the decisions made by the model are reliable and responsible

Within the field of Machine Learning, I am primarily ‚Äì but not exclusively ‚Äì interested in following subjects:
* Interpretable Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
* Computer Vision
* Reinforcement Learning
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### ‚úèÔ∏è Articles
#### [Detection of knee or elbow points](https://medium.com/p/d13fc517a63c)
On the blog *Towards Data Science*, I have published a scientific article that deals with the handling of the Python package `kneed`. In this article, the underlying algorithm Kneedle is presented. It shows how to identify knee or elbow points (i.e., data points at which the function graph rises or falls the most) with Python in the best possible way. Based on the mathematical definition of curvature for continuous functions, Kneedle detects those beneficial data points showing the best balance inherent tradeoffs ‚Äî called ‚Äúknees‚Äù (curves that have negative concavity) or sometimes ‚Äúelbows‚Äù (curves that have positive concavity) ‚Äî in discrete data sets. Finally, useful application examples for the detection of knee or elbow points in Machine Learning are shown.
