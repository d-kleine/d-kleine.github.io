I'm a Psychologist turned into a Data Scientist specialized in Artificial Intelligence (traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning) with a basic knowledge of Business Administration. Advanced programming skills in Python. Language skills in German, English, and Spanish.

Within the field of Machine Learning, I am primarily ‚Äì but not exclusively ‚Äì interested in these subjects:
* Interpretable Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
* Computer Vision
* Reinforcement Learning

#### [Detection of knee or elbow points](https://medium.com/p/d13fc517a63c)
On the blog *Towards Data Science*, I have published a scientific article that deals with the handling of the Python package `kneed`. In this article, the underlying algorithm Kneedle is presented. It shows how to identify knee or elbow points (i.e., data points at which the function graph rises or falls the most) with Python in the best possible way. Based on the mathematical definition of curvature for continuous functions, Kneedle detects those beneficial data points showing the best balance inherent tradeoffs ‚Äî called ‚Äúknees‚Äù (curves that have negative concavity) or sometimes ‚Äúelbows‚Äù (curves that have positive concavity) ‚Äî in discrete data sets. Finally, useful application examples for the detection of knee or elbow points in Machine Learning are shown.
